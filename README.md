docker-alpine

## Versioning
This will largely stick to the `<major>.<minor>` versions of Alpine and is maintained in file `.alpine_version`. Should there be a need to move onto a future version of alpine, then the file should be updated with the corresponding `<major>.<minor>` found on https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine

This will be build periodically to pull down any patches made upstream. Existing tags in quay will be updated
